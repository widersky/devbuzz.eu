# How I changed my workflow with Slack

Slack is a crutch. Don't get me wrong - it's an irreplaceable tool. However, it's a web-based messenger and the more channels you have, the harder it is to organize them properly.
There are various ways to organize your channels in Slack. You can group them, mutate the unnecessary, give them the appropriate prefixes. 
But I've always believed that the less the better and a few days ago I revolutionized the way I work with Slack.

## I hid all channels

That's it and that's it. I already explain what the power of this solution is. Office work exposes us to a constant stream of distractions of all kinds - notifications, apps, emails, chats - and yet we just want to work. 
There are plenty of methods to cut down on distractions and probably many more will be created. But what if we **cannot** turn off notifications, but we still get them? Personally, I have a problem with clicking.
I click on everything and everywhere, I look into chat rooms, I click through and look for inspiration - but inspiration is hard to come by when there's a constant war for our attention. It is not easy to change bad habits developed over the years, but you can try to
to make them more difficult for yourself. And that's how I made it harder for myself to click. My Slack is configured to show me only **unread** chats (right-click on chat group -> "show" -> "unread messages only"). You can probably imagine by now,
how much I can't see anything in the side panel - and that's exactly the point!

## CMD + K your best friend

Or `CTRL + K`, depends who's asking. The shortcut has already taken hold on the web quite well, it usually triggers a search within a page (not the browser one, just the page one). The same in Slack - `CMD + K` allows me to instantly jump
between channels whose names I usually remember more or less - or at least enough to easily search for them from here. At the same time, I have visible channels on the left that **actually** need my attention at any given time.

A quick pro tip worth trying - maybe it will make your job a little easier :) Minimalism is good for productivity!
