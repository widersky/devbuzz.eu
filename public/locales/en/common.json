    "whoAmIText2": "Work is also my passion, but it' s impossible to live only by programming, so a few words from a different barrel :) I graduated from Technical High School in Praszka in 2011. Shortly afterwards I went to study graphics and advertising - I stopped after a year to focus fully on professional development. I have been living in Lodz for a few years now - before that I was moving around Poland. I can't do nothing - it's both an advantage and a curse.",

    "whatIDoText1": "I've been dealing with computers since I was a kid and even then I became interested in programming. Thanks to computer I can create something from nothing - only my imagination limits me. For over 7 years I've been creating professionally and it seems that I'm doing quite well :) I specialize in dedicated solutions based on WordPress and ReactJS along with related technologies.",
    "whatIDoText2": "In work, independently of the path I use the latest but at the same time proven solutions that guarantee speed and reliability.",
    "whatIDoText3": "I feel great in these solutions:",

    "homeHeading3": "I'm always looking for ways to grow",
    "homeText5": "The profession I have chosen literally requires constant adaptation to change and learning. I keep up to date with the development of global web trends - exactly for this reason Falcon is based on the fastest, yet relatively new ESBuild bundler and TailwindCSS.",
    "homeText6": "Growth for me, however, is not just about that, but also about looking for new opportunities to optimize all the processes around my work - including how I feel or what and in what quantities I drink.",
